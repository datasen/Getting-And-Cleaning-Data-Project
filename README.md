 This project wil create one R script called run_analysis.R which will perform the following.

# Project Summary

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Additional Information
More information about the variables, data and transformations are in the CodeBook.MD file.
